`Big Data: 20 Free Big Data Sources Everyone Should Know <http://www.smartdatacollective.com/bernardmarr/235366/big-data-20-free-big-data-sources-everyone-should-know>`_
====================================================================================================================================================================================


I always make the point that data is everywhere – and that a lot of it is free. Companies don't necessarily have to build their own massive data repositories before starting with big data analytics. The moves by companies and governments to put large amounts of information into the public domain have made large volumes of data accessible to everyone.

Any company, from big blue chip corporations to the tiniest start-up can now leverage more data than ever before. Many of my clients ask me for the top data sources they could use in their big data endeavour and here's my rundown of some of the best free big data sources available today.

1. Data.gov http://data.gov


The US Government pledged last year to make all government data available freely online. This site is the first stage and acts as a portal to all sorts of amazing information on everything from climate to crime.

2. US Census Bureau http://www.census.gov/data.html


A wealth of information on the lives of US citizens covering population data, geographic data and education.

3. European Union Open Data Portal http://open-data.europa.eu/en/data/


As the above, but based on data from European Union institutions.

4. Data.gov.uk http://data.gov.uk/

5. The CIA World Factbook https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/

Huge resource of public data, including the 1000 Genome Project, an attempt to build the most comprehensive database of human genetic information and NASA's database of satellite imagery of Earth.

9. Facebook Graph https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api

Although much of the information on users' Facebook profile is private, a lot isn't – Facebook provide the Graph API as a way of querying the huge amount of information that its users are happy to share with the world (or can't hide because they haven't worked out how the privacy settings work). 

10. Gapminder http://www.gapminder.org/data/

Compilation of data from sources including the World Health Organization and World Bank covering economic, medical and social statistics from around the world.

14. National Climatic Data Center http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/quick-links#loc-clim

16. Topsy http://topsy.com/

Free, comprehensive social media data is hard to come by – after all their data is what generates profits for the big players (Facebook, Twitter etc) so they don't want to give it away. However Topsy provides a searchable database of public tweets going back to 2006 as well as several tools to analyze the conversations. 

17. Likebutton http://likebutton.com/

Mines Facebook's public data - globally and from your own network - to give an overview of what people "Like" at the moment.

18. New York Times http://developer.nytimes.com/docs

I hope this list is useful and you now agree with me that a lack of data is not a valid excuse for delaying any big data initiatives? Also, feel free to comment and add any other of your free big data sources to this list using the comment field below.
