From Ubuntu to Arch. 
==========================

In this document I will share some of my experience of 
installing linux, working on linux, and enjoying linux.
Since enccounted with Ubuntu 8.04, I quite enjoy the process of
learning and playing with this system.

By linux, I get to prefering doing things by typing than clicking.
And I quite enjoy this habit. Typing is exciting. Through Linux, I learnt
to know what is a real geek. And I found many thing in linux is much more
enjoyable than the computer games in MS window. Building my personal site,
running up some net service to help others, and coding with emacs, etc.

Anyway, linux is the most basic tool for a computer geek. As to me, who intend
to be a hacker, linux can't be replaced.
