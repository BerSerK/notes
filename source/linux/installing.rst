Installing and A brief view of My preferred Softwares
******************************************************

On these section, I will give some relatively detailed experience
on linux.

Installing ubuntu
==============================

Thanks the god, there is ubuntu for newbies.
It's easy to install. Nothing special to say, just be careful when
you are formatting your hard-disk.

The software source I recommend to use in pku is that of bjtu.

You can check it out on http://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn

The speed is about 10M/s within our school net.


Installing Arch
========================================

I used the way of usb key to install the archlinux.

1.  Make a usb key for installation.

    a. I followed the way called `UNetBootin <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_Installation_Media#UNetBootin>`_
    #. And you can `Dowload UNetBootin From here<http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/>`_
    #. I do these on my ubuntu, and everything goes fine.
       It only takes about 160M space of my usb key.


#.  Intall the base arch on the desktop. 
    PS: Here I enccounted in a
    problem that an error message comes up something like "Cann't
    find the ARCH_201005 disk". And rename my usb key as ARCH2010 
    solved this problem.


#. Config the arch linux. I will detail these in the next section.

Config Arch
