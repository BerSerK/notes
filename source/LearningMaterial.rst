推荐学习材料
========================================

1. 统计: `An Introduction to Statistical Learning <http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/>`_ 
2. Coding, we need to learn at least two Programming Language, a low level one like C++, and a high level one Python. We can develop compute-intensive projects with the low level one, and we can finish projects in a fast way with the high level one. :

   a. C++ Primer. Hell not C++ Primer Plus. If you don't want to be a pure C++ Programmer, any C++ book is OK.
   b. `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ as a scripting language, can highly enhance our working efficiency. You can Learn it from `Python Tutorial<https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html>`_ in a week, if you know some thing about programming.
   c. Maybe you will be like to know about R, MATLAB, Mathematica, Fortran, Java, Ruby. Even you need to know something about Erlang, LISP, Haskell, which are known as `Functional programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming>`_ .

3. Algorithm: 

   a. `LeetCode <https://leetcode.com/>`_ is a shortcut to both coding and algorithm.
   b. `Introduction to Algorithms, third edition <https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms>`_ `算法导论(原书第2版) <http://book.douban.com/subject/1885170/>`_ is a comprehensive book, including basic algorithm and some deep topics like "linear programming".
   c. `The Art of Computer Programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming>`_ `计算机程序设计艺术 <https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh/计算机程序设计艺术>`_ is a seiries of books consist of 7 volumes. It's author `高德纳（Donald Ervin Knuth) <https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/高德纳>`_ is truely a legendary figure who invented `TeX <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX>`_ .

4. Quantitative Strategy:
   
   a. `WebSim of WorldQuant <https://websim.worldquantchallenge.com/>`_ provides many usefull videos and ideas. [1]_
   b. `Quantitative Equity Portfolio Management <http://book.douban.com/subject/2799221/>`_ ( `证券组合定量管理 <http://book.douban.com/subject/6715019/>`_ ) shows another Genre of Quantitative Finance different from the " `WorldQuant <https://www.worldquant.com/>`_ way". [2]_

5. Other skills:

   a. Version Control, `Git <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)>`_ (/ɡɪt/) is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. `Github <https://github.com/>`_ is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. And you can learn Git In a quick way from `Pro Git <http://git-scm.com/book/zh/v1>`_ .
   b. Text Editor: 

      I. `GNU Emacs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs>`_ is an extensible, customizable text editor—and more.
      II. `Vim <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)>`_ (/vɪm/; a contraction of Vi IMproved) is a clone of Bill Joy's vi editor for Unix.
      III. `Sublime Text <http://www.sublimetext.com/>`_ is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.
      
      I'm an Emacs User since 2010. 俗话说: "Vim是编辑器之神, Emacs是神之编辑器." For new coder, I recommend you to start with Sublime which is more fashion 'and more'.
      
   c. Documentation Tools.
      
      I. `Python-Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation, written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD license. And it's the tool `this site <http://notes.yeshiwei.com>`_ built with.
      II. `Doxygen <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>`_ is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources, but it also supports other popular programming languages such as C, Objective-C, C#, PHP, Java, Python, IDL (Corba, Microsoft, and UNO/OpenOffice flavors), Fortran, VHDL, Tcl, and to some extent D.

6. Suggested Reading:

   a. `How to Become a Hacker <http://catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#why_this>`_
   b. Go to `Quora <http://quora.com/>`_ to follow topics and and people you interested in.
   c. 去 `知乎 <http://www.zhihu.com>`_ 去关注你感兴趣的人和话题.
